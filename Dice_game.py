###### DEFINING ROLL ######

### Makes the dice roll for the player and works out the total for that roll ###

###### DICE ROLL ######

### This rolls the dice 5 times for the players, and then adds up the total. If the scores are equal, it starts a tie breaker and determines the winner off that ###

###### WORKING OUT THE WINNER ######

### This checks which score is bigger, then creates a tuple for my leaderboard code ( Gotton of stack overflow ) ###

###### CODE TO UPLOAD ALL SCORES TO A FILE ######

### This will store the winners username and score in a text file ###

winner = (Winner_Points,',',winner_User)
f = open('Winner.txt', 'a')
f.write(''.join(winner))
f.write('\n')
f.close()


###### CODE TO LOAD, UPDATE AND SORT LEADERBOARD ######

### This loads the leaderboard into an array, then compares the scores just gotton and replaces it ###

f = open('Leaderboard.txt', 'r')
leaderboard = [line.replace('\n','') for line in f.readlines()]
f.close()


for idx, item in enumerate(leaderboard):
    if item.split(', ')[1] == winner[1] and int(item.split(', ')[0]) < int(winner[0]):
            leaderboard[idx] = '{}, {}'.format(winner[0], winner[1])
    else:
        pass 

### This sorts the leaderboard in reverse, and then rewrites it ###

leaderboard.sort(reverse=True)

with open('Leaderboard.txt', 'w') as f:
    for item in leaderboard:
        f.write("%s\n" % item)
